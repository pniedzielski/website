    <p><i>From Zero To Iterators</i> was presented at CppCon 2016
    in Bellevue, WA.  I have a thesis that most people don't
    appreciate iterators nearly enough, even in the C++ community.
    This talk builds up the fundamentals of the iterator
    hierarchy, showing how we can use it to write correct, generic
    software making the minimal set of assumptions about our
    inputs.  Then, it gives a taste of the way we can extend this
    to write cache-aware, parallelizable data structures.</p>
