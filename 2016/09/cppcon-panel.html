    (Invited panelist)
    <p>I appeared on a panel at CppCon 2016 on teaching C++ to
    university students.  While an undergraduate, I taught
    a <a href="https://github.com/nskicpp">course on C++</a>,
    which allowed me to offer a different perspective than the
    rest of the panel.  Unfortunately (I feel), much of the panel
    discussion and many of the questions revolved around teaching
    C++ as a first language to incoming first-years—a topic I hold
    neutral-to-negative opinions of—or teaching it to
    non-programmers for tasks where a scripting language really
    makes a lot more sense.</p>
