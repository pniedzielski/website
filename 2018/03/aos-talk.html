    <p>The Sumerian clause is characterized by a highly synthetic
    verbal complex that is preceded by free nominals, whose
    relative order is governed largely by information structure.
    Despite the over century-long study of Sumerian, though, the
    details of its clausal syntax are poorly understood.  The
    large array of verbal properties that can be marked within the
    verbal complex, the tendency for pragmatically inferable
    nominals to be dropped, and the many different morphological
    analyses of the verbal complex in the literature have largely
    conspired against in-depth study of Sumerian syntax.</p>

    <p>I argue that the behavior of two of the cross-referencing
    morphological slots in the verbal template—the final
    person-prefix (FPP) slot before the verb stem and the person
    suffix (PS) slot after the verb stem—points to the existence
    of an underlying configurational structure.  In particular, I
    argue that the PS is not pronominal cross-referencing, as is
    commonly assumed, but rather true agreement, the result of a
    (Multiple) Agree relation (Chomsky 2001, Hiraiwa 2001, and
    others) with the structurally highest active nominal in the
    clause.  In contrast, the FPP is a doubled pronominal clitic
    that moves into its position in the verbal complex
    post-syntactically.</p>

    <p>In support of this, I provide an analysis of the ergative
    cross-referencing split between the <i lang="akk">ḫamṭu</i> and
    <i lang="akk">marû</i> aspects, adapted from previous analyses
    of other ergative languages.  I then show that this analysis
    allows for a principled account of the third-person plural
    agent marking in <i lang="akk">ḫamṭu</i> forms, which is
    distributed between an FPP /n-/ and a PS /-eš/.</p>
