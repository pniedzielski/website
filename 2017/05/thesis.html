    <p>Sumerian is a language isolate that was spoken until about
    four millennia ago in southern Mesopotamia.  It is known
    through thousands of inscriptions written in the cuneiform
    writing system dating back to the Uruk IV period
    (4<sup>th</sup> millennium B.C.).  Sumerian is a
    nonconfigurational language with a highly synthetic
    sentence-final verbal complex carrying much of the grammatical
    information in the sentence.  Having had very little formal
    morphosyntactic treatment within linguistic theory, but having
    a fairly large corpus of texts preserved and a strong
    scholarly tradition within Assyriology, Sumerian presents
    itself a fruitful source of syntactic study.</p>

    <p>In this thesis, I argue for an analysis of the syntax of
    Sumerian as underlyingly configurational, with the verbal
    complex morphologically realizing the C′ of a clause.  All
    free nominals obligatorily move to vacate the C′ to allow the
    verbal complex to be realized as a single phonological word,
    either to higher adjunct positions, yielding the apparent
    nonconfigurationality of constituents preceding the verbal
    complex, or by undergoing movement to a dedicated and
    configurational focus position.</p>

    <p>The evidence for this analysis comes in two parts.  First,
    I analyze the A-syntax of Sumerian and show that the
    split-ergative nature of cross-referencing in the verbal
    complex and the <i lang="de">Dimensionalkasussystem</i> of
    oblique cross-referencing morphemes can all be explained by
    syntactic analyses that roughly mirror the morphological
    structure of the verbal complex.  I argue that the apparent
    asymmetries between the verbal complex and syntactic structure
    must be explained by morpho-phonological, not syntactic,
    processes.  Then, I analyze two A′ processes in Sumerian,
    namely V-to-C movement in imperatives and
    <i>wh</i>-movement in questions, to give further evidence for
    the claim that free nominals obligatorily vacate from their
    lower positions into higher positions in the left
    periphery.</p>
