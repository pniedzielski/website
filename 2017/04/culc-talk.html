    <p>The Sumerian language, which was spoken in Early to Middle
    Bronze Age Mesopotamia and attested on cuneiform texts,
    displays a head-marking pattern in the verbal complex that is
    split-ergative based on aspect.  In the imperfective aspect,
    subject cross-referencing is marked in the morphological slot
    following the verbal stem and object cross-referencing is
    marked preceding the verbal stem, shown in (1) and (2).  In
    the perfective aspect, though, <em>ergative</em>
    cross-referencing is marked in the slot preceding the verbal
    stem, while \textit{absolutive} cross-referencing is marked
    following the verbal stem, shown in (3) and (4).  Case marking
    on free nominals in the clause do not show this split, instead
    always seeming to follow an ergative-absolutive alignment.
    The split in the verbal complex is summarized in Table 1
    below:</p>

    <p>In this talk, I argue on the basis of this split that
    Sumerian shows Aldridge (2005, 2008)'s \textit{T-type}
    ergative agreement pattern, in which a probe in
    T\textsuperscript{0} establishes an Agree relation with the
    absolutive nominal.  This account explains the alternation in
    the interpretation of the pre-stem and post-stem morphological
    slots, as well as predicts the simplified verbal template
    found in non-finite verbs.  This account also fits with the
    diachronic pathway of ergativity posited for Sumerian by
    Coghill and Deutscher (2002).</p>
