    <p>The Sumerian verbal complex displays a head-marking pattern
    that is split-ergative based on aspect. In the imperfective,
    subject marking follows the verbal stem and object marking
    preceding the verbal stem. In the perfective aspect, though,
    ergative marking precedes the verbal stem, and absolutive
    marking follows the verbal stem.</p>

    <p>I argue on the basis of this split that Sumerian shows an
    ergative agreement pattern that identifies absolutive case
    with abstract nominative case (Woolford 1999), in which a
    probe in T⁰ establishes an Agree relation with the absolutive
    nominal.  This account explains the alternation in the
    interpretation of the pre-stem and post-stem morphological
    slots, as well as predicts the simplified verbal template
    found in non-finite verbs.</p>
