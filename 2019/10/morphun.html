      It is commonly accepted that morphological dependencies are
      finite-state in nature.  Aksenova, Graf & Moradi (2016) argue
      that the upper bound on morphological expressivity is much
      lower.  Drawing on technical results from computational
      phonology, they show that a variety of morphotactic phenomena
      are tier-based strictly local and do not fall into weaker
      subclasses such as the strictly local or strictly piecewise
      languages.  Since the tier-based strictly local languages are
      learnable in the limit from positive texts, this marks a first
      important step towards general machine learning algorithms for
      morphology.  Furthermore, the limitation to tier-based strictly
      local languages explains typological gaps that are puzzling from
      a purely linguistic perspective.
